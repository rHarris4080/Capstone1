Hypothesis Testing - World Happiness Report 2015-2020

Author: Rob Harris 2/21

**Context:** 
This was my first major project in the data science flex cerfication program, and I quickly realized how many directions a research project can take.  I had some misconceptions early in the process that hindered much of my early progress.  I feel that a lot of time went into basic research that is not reflected in the final presentation itself, but that process was invaluable for my long term growth and understanding as a data scientist.  I do feel a bit underwhelmed looking at this project now, but again I consider this a learning opportunity for my professional development.

**Abstract:** 
The Worldwide Happiness Report is a dataset found on Kaggle that measures how happy a country’s citizens are.  Data was provided from 2015-2020.  Many categories were included factoring into a country’s overall happiness rank.  While many categories overlapped from year to year, many differed on their content and how that content was reported. Therefore, instead of comparing data from year to year I decided to focus on the most recent year provided 2020. The stakeholder is anyone interested in what people perceive as happiness relative to where in the world you live. Stakeholders will have a small insight into one aspect of worldwide happiness that could be a segue into further data analysis.
1. Introduction: Worldwide Happiness Report
We all want to be "Happy" in whatever context we feel happiness lies. Job satisfaction, freedoms and liberty, family, religion, social justice, governmental policies, and freedom to exercise our perceived rights are just a few of the determining factors. Instead of just analyzing the most or least happy countries, I wanted to compare the happier countries with the less happy countries in one category. So, I decided to compare the first quartile(Q1) ranking of 'Freedom to make life choices' with the third quartile(Q3) same ranking for the year 2020.
2. Hypothesis:
Ho: There is no significant difference between the average 'Freedom to make life choices' rankings as measured at the 1st quartile versus that as measured at the 3rd quartile.
Ha: There is a significant difference between the average 'Freedom to make life choices' rankings as measured at the 1st quartile versus that as measured at the 3rd quartile.
3. Data:
The data comes from Kaggle measuring 153 countries where rankings are comprised of 20 variables. The dataset is found through the following link:

4. Methods:
For this analysis I used pandas for comparing World Happiness variables of 'Freedom to make life choices' rankings with the third quartile and first quartile rankings for the year 2020.

**Open to Feedback:**
Please feel free to critique and offer any suggestions you would have.  I very much look forward to hearing from anyone willing to offer their expertise.
